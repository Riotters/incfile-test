There is a fee to file and start an LLC in Michigan, but you only need to file your Articles of Organization once.</p></br>\r\n            <p><a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\">Form your LLC now</a></p>`, //https://www.incfile.com/form-order-now.php?entityType=LLC&entityState=ID\r\n        },\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n    marginBottom: 48,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    type: `header`,\r\n    content: `Special Types of LLCs in Michigan`,\r\n    size: 3,\r\n    marginBottom: 24,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    type: `accordion`,\r\n    content: {\r\n      items: [\r\n        {\r\n          question: `Professional LLCs`,\r\n          answer: `<p>Some states, including Michigan, allow certain occupations to form “Professional LLCs.” These types of businesses typically have special requirements and licensing.
