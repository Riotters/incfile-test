      <Paragraph big>
        Since you wonâ€™t be able to run your bar or club solo, you will need to hire employees. Additionally, because bar and server wages are typically very low and supplemented with tips, expect to have a fairly high staff turnover. This could mean you spend a lot of time interviewing and hiring.

      <Paragraph big>
        Your bartenders will be mixing and pouring drinks, which means their speed, efficiency and pour accuracy will all have a direct impact on your profitability. For that reason, it's vital to train your bartenders well. Be aware that both over-pouring and theft can be fairly common in the bar
        and club industry, so try to hire people you know you can trust.
