          text: `The abbreviation "LLC" stands for limited liability company. The name refers to one of the primary benefits of this business entity type—LLCs allow business owners to keep their personal assets separate from those of the company. This effectively limits their own liability when it comes to company debts and responsibilities.`,

        text2: `In the United States, a limited liability company is a business entity type that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation, creating the best of both worlds for business owners. LLCs have rapidly become one of the most popular business structures for new and small businesses, largely because they are considered to be simpler and more flexible than a corporation.`,

        text: `If you don't plan on raising investment money for your business, think you might need asset protection and need flexible business management and taxes, then an LLC is likely the best choice for your business. Whether you are a sole proprietor, have a partner, or a multi-member corporation, the LLC is a great choice for small business owners, as it can provide the same limited liability protection as a corporation, without many of the complexities and formalities associated with them. At Incfile we see all sizes and verticals of businesses forming an LLC — from LLCs for real estate agents or financial advisors to solopreneurs such as personal trainers or even marijuana businesses. A number of entrepreneurs decide that an LLC is the business structure that fits their needs.`,
        text2: `Some businesses are prevented from forming an LLC, however. Typically financial companies such as banks, financial trust companies and insurance agencies can't file as an LLC. LLCs are sometimes limited for industries in certain states, too. For example, if you live in California, you can't form an LLC if you're an architect, accountant or licensed health care provider. Check out our LLC information by state for more details on your state.`,

      {
        question: `How does business asset protection work with LLCs?`,
        answer: `The limited liability company structure, much like a corporation, provides LLC owners with limited liability asset protection. 
                  This means that the company assets are typically owned by the LLC and are separate from the personal assets from that of the LLC owner(s). 
                  Should there be a lawsuit aimed at the company, whether with or without merit, the LLC is the legal entity that would be sued. The assets of the LLC could be attacked, 
                  however that would be separate from the personal assets of the LLC owner(s), which would be protected.

                  The potential liability of an LLC owner is limited only to whatever that owner has invested in the LLC, such as an initial, investment or any retained earnings. 
                  This is very much the same as if you had purchased shares of stock in a corporation. In most cases, the most you can lose is what you paid for the stock, but you typically will not lose more than that, 
                  no matter how much the company might potentially lose or for however much the company might be sued.`,
      },
      {
        question: `What is an LLC member?`,
        answer: `The state fee varies by state our service fee to file Articles of Dissolution is $149. To review the fee in your state click on the “order now” button and select the state and entity type.`,
      },
      {
        question: `How do I file an amendment for an LLC?`,
        answer: `The only stipulation that would prohibit the owners of an entity from filing a dissolution is if the company owes outstanding taxes or has annual reports outstanding. 
                  In this event the company would need to bring the itself to good standing with the state before filing the dissolution.`,
      },
      {
        question: `Can you start an LLC by yourself?`,
        answer: `The filing time is dependent on the governing state agency and varies by state.`,
      },
      {
        question: `How do LLC owners pay themselves?`,
        answer: `The governing state agency will return a copy of the filed articles which are then mailed to the client.`,
