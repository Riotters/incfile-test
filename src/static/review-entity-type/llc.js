              question:
                  `How does business asset protection work with LLCs?`,
              answer:
                  `The limited liability company structure, much like a corporation, provides LLC owners with limited liability asset protection. 
                  This means that the company assets are typically owned by the LLC and are separate from the personal assets from that of the LLC owner(s). 
                  Should there be a lawsuit aimed at the company, whether with or without merit, the LLC is the legal entity that would be sued. The assets of the LLC could be attacked, 
                  however that would be separate from the personal assets of the LLC owner(s), which would be protected.

                  The potential liability of an LLC owner is limited only to whatever that owner has invested in the LLC, such as an initial, investment or any retained earnings. 
                  This is very much the same as if you had purchased shares of stock in a corporation. In most cases, the most you can lose is what you paid for the stock, but you typically will not lose more than that, 
                  no matter how much the company might potentially lose or for however much the company might be sued.`,

              question:

              answer:
                  `The only stipulation that would prohibit the owners of an entity from filing a dissolution is if the company owes outstanding taxes or has annual reports outstanding. 
                  In this event the company would need to bring the itself to good standing with the state before filing the dissolution.`,
