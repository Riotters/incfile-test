        `A “Fictitious Business Name” (FBN) is a name you choose to do business under that can be different from the official legal name of your LLC or corporation. 
        Fictitious business names normally need to be filed with the Secretary of State or other entity that governs business formation in your state. 
        If your business operates in multiple states, you'll likely need to file a fictitious name in any state where you have a presence.`,
