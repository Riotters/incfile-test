  text: `Every entrepreneur wants to maximize their business earnings, and one way to do that is through understanding and applying the proper business tax deductions. There are several expenses and tax write-offs that small business owners can take advantage of, and we’ve shared them below.`,
  header3: `Start with The Home Office Deduction`,
  text2: `If you work from home, the IRS allows you to deduct a portion of what you spend on utilities, mortgage interest, property taxes and other areas from your business earnings. There are two methods to do this.`,
  text3: `The IRS allows you to use a “simplified” method:`,
  list: [`Calculate the total square footage of the office in your home.`, `If the total is more than 300 square feet, reduce it to 300 square feet.`, `Multiply the result by $5.`, `That amount is what you can claim as a simplified home office tax deduction.`],
  text4: `You can also use the “regular” method, which requires you to track your utility and other home-related costs:`,
  list2: [`Calculate the total percentage of your home that’s exclusively used to run your business.`, `Apply this percentage to your utility bills and other expenses.`, `That amount is what you can claim as a home office deduction.`],
  list3: {
    header: `The expenses you may claim include:`,
    list: [`Interest on your mortgage payments`, `Rent payments`, `Real estate and property taxes`, `Home insurance and mortgage insurance premiums`, `Utility costs including gas, electric, water and trash collection`, `Cleaning services`],

  list5: {
    header: `As with the home office deduction, you have a couple of ways to work this out:`,
    list: [
      `Firstly, you can use a simplified version. Just track how many miles you travel for business and multiply that by 57.5 cents (the standard mileage rate in 2020) for the total amount you can deduct.`,
      `Alternatively, you can track your actual expenses (for example, lease costs, fuel costs, repairs, maintenance, etc) then multiply that by the percentage of time you use the vehicle for business purposes.`,
    ],

  header6: `Write Off Part of Your Business Taxes by Funding Retirement Accounts`,
  text9: `Retirement accounts are a great way to defer your income and get a tax deduction. You can use an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to defer up to $5,500 in income, although you will pay tax when you withdraw money from the account on retirement. Note that if you also have a separate 401(k) provided by your business, you can only earn up to a certain amount before you lose this deduction. Additionally, you can’t deduct contributions made to a Roth plan, either as an individual or as part of a 401(k).`,
  text10: `If you do have a 401(k) provided by your business, such as a SEP or SIMPLE plan, you can deduct contributions made to the IRA portion of the plan. These plans also have higher contribution and deductible limits than Individual Retirement Accounts.`,

  header8: `Take Advantage of Business Tax Credits`,
  text14: `The IRS provides incentives to businesses through tax credits. These credits do change from year to year, both in terms of availability and how much you can claim.`,

  header12: `Specialist Business Insurance Is Deductible`,
  text20: `Many businesses have extra insurance in place, whether that’s general liability, professional indemnity or something else. The premiums you pay for business insurance are tax-deductible.`,
  header13: `Remember to Talk to Your Accountant or Tax Preparer`,
  text21: `Every business circumstance is unique, and there may be situations where some of these deductions don’t apply, or where you could claim additional expenses. That’s why it’s always important to see a qualified account or tax professional and get their advice on your business affairs.`,
