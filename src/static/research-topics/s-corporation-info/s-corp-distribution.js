  text: `S Corporations can be a great way to reduce the amount of tax that you pay as a business owner. You can be treated as an S Corporation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a couple of different ways. You can choose to originally file as an S Corporation, or you can start a limited liability company (LLC) and file a Form 2553 to be treated as an S Corporation for tax purposes.`,

The IRS is aware that business owners may try to do this and have rules in place to prevent it. If you breach these rules, you will need to pay penalties, extra taxes and interest.`,
  text8: `The main rule is that you must pay any owners (or corporate officers) in the S Corporation a “reasonable salary.”`,

      `You should pay owners/corporate officers as much as they would reasonably earn performing the same role for another business.`,
