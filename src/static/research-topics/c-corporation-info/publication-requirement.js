  text: `A Publication Requirement is a compliance mandate that requires the creation and ownership of an LLC to publish an announcement in local newspapers upon being filed. Upon completion of this requirement an affidavit is typically filed with the state to inform them that the publication requirement has been satisfied. Currently the states which require thus are Pennsylvania (corporations only), Georgia (corporations only),
        <a href="/arizona-publication-newspaper-list/">Arizona (corporations and LLCs),</a>
        Nebraska (corporations and LLCs), and New York (LLCs only). At this time Incfile does not provide this service.`,
