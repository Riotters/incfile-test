  header2: `There are two main types of corporations the S-Corporation and the C-Corporation.`,
  text: `Every corporation is considered a C corp when it is formed with the Secretary of State. The distinction is made on a federal level and processed by the IRS.`,

  text3: `A C-corporation file a corporate tax return and will pay taxes on the profits. The post tax income may then be distributed to the corporation shareholders in the the form of dividends.

This is what is known as “double taxation.”`,
