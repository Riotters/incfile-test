  text: `A Corporation is managed and run by its directors and officers. The directors are appointed by the shareholders and are responsible for the overall management and corporate governance of the corporation. The directors appoint the officers who are responsible for the day to management and operations of the corporation. The typical officer positions are president, vice-president, treasurer, and secretary, although there can be more and sometimes different titles are used. In most states only one director and one officer is required, and they can usually be the same person.`,
