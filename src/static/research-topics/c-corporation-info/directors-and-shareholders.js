  text: `A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.`,
