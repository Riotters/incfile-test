  text: `The number of initial shares your corporation is authorized to distribute is specified in the Articles of Incorporation. The actual number is more or less arbitrary, at your discretion. Incfile uses a default number of 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), with a par value of one cent (if your state requires par value, otherwise no par value will be assigned). Some states charge more to form a corporation with a high number of shares and/or high par value.`,
