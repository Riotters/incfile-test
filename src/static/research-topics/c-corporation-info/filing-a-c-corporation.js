  text: `When deciding whether or not to convert a company to a C-corporation, entrepreneurs should consider whether the level of paperwork and taxation structure is the right fit for the business.`,
  text2: `Incorporation adds legal protections that can help keep personal assets secure and possibly reduce taxes. There are several options, including C-corporations.`,
  text3: `“Among the different types of business structures available in the U.S., almost all larger corporations with more than 100 shareholders and virtually all publicly traded companies are C corporations,” writes Elizabeth Wasserman for Inc. magazine.`,
  text4: `LLCs and S-corporations are often more popular among smaller businesses because they don’t mandate regular meetings and normally require less paperwork, Wasserman observes. But, if a business faces financial losses, shareholders may take the hit on their tax returns. This is because both LLCs and S-corporations pass profit and losses to individuals with a stake in the company.`,
  text5: `Other key benefits of C-corporations include medical reimbursement plans that employees can receive tax-free, added ownership arrangement flexibility for venture capitalists who want to invest in the startup, an easier transition to becoming a public company and the opportunity to collect future expansion earnings at a lower cost.`,
