    text3: `Typically, a nonprofit is a “separate entity” for tax, governance and management purposes, in a similar way to an LLC or corporation. Technically, a not-for-profit isn’t generally a separate legal entity, and doesn’t have a separate legal existence to its members. Not-for-profits are less common than nonprofits.`,

    header6: `The Tax-Exempt Status of These Organizations Does Differ `,
    text6: `Nonprofits can apply for tax-exempt status under the 501(c)(3) requirements of the IRS. There are strict guidelines that must be followed for Nonprofits that apply for a 501(c)(3) tax exemption do not need to pay tax on their funding and donations. If they pay employees, then they must pay standard payroll and other salary expenses, and their employees will also be subject to tax. A nonprofit can both employ people and maintain a volunteer program. Volunteers offer their time and services for free.`,
    text7: `Salaries for employees of nonprofit organizations are typically funded outside of the organization’s fundraising operations.`,
    text8: `Not-for-profits do not qualify for tax-exempt status under 501(c)(3). Instead, a not-for-profit needs to meet 501(c)(7) IRS guidelines to be considered for tax-exempt status. The IRS mandates that a not-for-profit must be organized for pleasure, recreation and other similar non-profitable purposes. It is generally more difficult to become tax-exempt as a not-for-profit than as a nonprofit. Not-for-profits are often run by volunteers, not paid workers. Not-for-profits may have a “membership roster” that benefits from the organization in some way, such as having expenses paid.`,

    header7: `Banks May Treat These Organizations Differently`,
    text9: `Some banks see a clear distinction between nonprofits and not-for-profits. This is mainly due to nonprofits being considered as an independent legal entity, while not-for-profits are not. This may affect how easy it is to get a bank account and the requirements an organization will need to follow.`,
    header8: `Nonprofits Have a Charter, Not-for-Profits Do Not`,
    text10: `A nonprofit normally has a national or state charter. This charter often provides people involved with the nonprofit with legal and financial protections. Nonprofits have a board that oversees and directs the organization. Not-for-profits typically do not have a charter and are not normally required to have a board.`,
