  text: `Yes, a Nonprofit Corporation may generate a profit. Nonprofit does not literally mean that a Corporation cannot make a profit. A Nonprofit Corporation can acquire more income that it spends on its exempt purpose. This profit can be utilized for operating expenses, including salaries. However, a Nonprofit Corporation may not utilize its income to profit any director or officer.`,
