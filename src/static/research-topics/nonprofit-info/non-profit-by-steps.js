It is important that your organizing documents contain the required language and specific clauses, such as a detailed exempt purpose statement, to ensure that your nonprofit will meet the requirements to qualify for Federal 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. If you choose to incorporate your nonprofit through IncFile, you only need to complete the online order form. IncFile will prepare and file your organizing documents.`,
