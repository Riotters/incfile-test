It is important that your organizing documents contain the required language and specific clauses, such as a detailed exempt purpose statement, to ensure that your nonprofit will meet the requirements to qualify for Federal 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. If you choose to incorporate your nonprofit through Incfile, you only need to complete the online order form. Incfile will prepare and file your organizing documents.`,
