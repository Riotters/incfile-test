If you incorporate through IncFile, we will request a first and second name choice for your nonprofit and complete a name availability search to assure that your name is available and not deceptively similar to any other legal entity. Further, you must choose a name that clearly indicates that your nonprofit is incorporated, by including the words “Corporation”, “Incorporated”, “Corp.”, or “Inc.” in your name.`,
