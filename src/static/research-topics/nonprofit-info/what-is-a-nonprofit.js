    text: `A Nonprofit Corporation is a Corporation whose principal purpose is public benefit and not for producing a profit. A Nonprofit Corporation may not distribute income to benefit its officers and/or directors. More importantly, a Nonprofit Corporation is not an ordinary business and should not be used as an alternative form for a business with the primary purpose of generating a profit.`,
