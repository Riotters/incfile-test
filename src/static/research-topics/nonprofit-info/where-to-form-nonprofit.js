    header: `Where Should I Form my Nonprofit Corporation?`,
    text: `You are not required to form your nonprofit in the state where it will be physically located. However, practical matters in choosing a location to incorporate should be taken into consideration, such as the state fees and the taxation laws governing that state. If your nonprofit corporation will have only a few officers or directors and most of the activities will take place in one state, it is advisable to incorporate in that state. The disadvantages of not incorporating in your home state include the requirement of having to qualify to do business in a foreign state, being subjected to taxes in both your state of incorporation and the state in which you conduct business, and being susceptible to a law suit in your state of incorporation as well as the state in which you conduct business.`,
