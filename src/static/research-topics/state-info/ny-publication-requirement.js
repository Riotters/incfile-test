  header: `How to Meet New York LLC Publication Requirements`,
  text: `If you’re starting a limited liability company in the state of New York, there’s an extra step you’ll need to take once you’ve filed your Articles of Organization.

You’ll need to complete this process if you’re creating a domestic or foreign LLC in NY, and you’ll have to do so within 120 days of starting your LLC.`,

  text4: `You’ll need to get in touch with your local County Clerk, which will be in the same county as your LLC’s “principal office.” You can find their details through a quick Google search. Visit their website and find out how they want you to get in touch — typically via mail or an in-person visit.`,
  header5: `The County Clerk Will Tell You Where to Publish Your Notices`,
  text5: `Send the County Clerk a copy of your NY Department of State LLC filing receipt. Once they’ve received that, they’ll tell you where to publish a notice of the formation of your LLC. The two newspapers they ask you to publish in may vary or rotate, so it’s important to get a formal notification from them prior to publishing — you cannot choose the newspapers yourself. Typically, they will tell you to publish in both a daily and a weekly newspaper.`,
  header6: `Contact Newspapers to Publish an NY LLC Notice`,
  text6: `Publishing the details of your LLC is standard in NY state, so the newspapers should have a fairly simple way for you to meet those requirements.`,

    list: [

  header7: `Publish Your NY LLC Notice for Six Weeks`,
  text7: `It’s not sufficient to just publish your LLC in two separate newspapers for one week. NY state law requires you to publish the notice for six consecutive weeks. Because this is a standard requirement, the newspapers should have an easy process you can use for repeat publication.`,
  header8: `Receive an Affidavit of Publication from the Newspapers`,
  text8: `After you’ve met publication requirements, each newspaper will send you an Affidavit of Publication. Don’t worry, you’re almost done.`,

  header12: `What Happens If I Fail to Comply with the LLC Publication Requirement?`,

  header13: `How Much Does It Cost to Meet Publication Requirements?`,
  text12: `You’ll need to pay newspapers to publish details about your LLC, and then pay the Department of State to process the Certificate of Publication. The cost of publishing in a daily or weekly newspaper can vary widely, and could be up to $1,000.`,
