	header: `Does Incfile have a Discount or Coupon Code?`,
	text: `You may have read several articles advertising that they have an Incfile Coupon Code. But the truth is, an Incfile discount doesn’t actually exist.`,
	text2: `Incfile passes the savings along to you by charging ⅓ the price of many of their competitors with pricing starting at just $0. This is the lowest-priced package in the industry.`,
	text3: `Although the Incfile discount code doesn’t exist – you don’t really need it. LegalZoom, for instance, has a basic package that will incorporate a business for $149, which is $100 more than Incfile and doesn’t include the 1st full year of Registered Agent Service that Incfile provides with every package.`,
	text4: `That’s more than $250 you’ll be saving with Incfile that can be put right back to work in your new business. Not to mention, you get Registered Agent service free of charge for a year to keep your business in compliance.`,
	text5: `Even if you go to other incorporation services, you’ll still be paying more even if you have a coupon.`,
	header2: `Here’s What You Get With Incfile for $0`,
	text6: `With Incfile, you can incorporate your business at just $0, plus the state fees which vary depending on your state. Plus, for this price, you can get a lot of services to kickstart your business that you would normally have to pay extra for with other companies.`,
	text7: `Here are the top six reasons why you’ll still be better off without an Incfile coupon code.`,
	list: [
		`Each of the three Incfile packages include Registered Agent service FREE for the first full year.`,
		`Incfile gives you unlimited access to email and phone support to assist with any questions and concerns.`,
		`A FREE 30-minute Business Tax Consultation is provided with every package.`,
		`Incfile has an order tracking tool that will allow you to monitor the status of your order in real time. You can use it anytime of the day!`,
		`Each order includes Next Day Processing. Incfile will conduct a name search, draft your articles and forward to the state for processing in just one business day. Even though the filing times vary per state – Incfile gets them over to the state in one business day, then mails your company formation documents upon the state’s completion.`,

	header3: `Wrapping Up and Incorporating with Incfile`,
	text8: `Unlike many other incorporation service providers, Incfile handles every step of the incorporation process within the company – rather than outsourcing it. As a result, they are able to completely control the incorporation process and make sure it’s done right.`,
	text9: `Like I said before, even though an Incfile coupon doesn’t technically exist, the savings have already been factored in to save you time and money.`,
