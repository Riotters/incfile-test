    header: `Does Incfile have a Discount or Coupon Code?`,
    text: `You may have read several articles advertising that they have an IncFile Coupon Code. But the truth is, an IncFile discount doesn’t actually exist.`,
    text2: `IncFile passes the savings along to you by charging ⅓ the price of many of their competitors with pricing starting at just $49. This is the lowest-priced package in the industry.`,
    text3: `Although the IncFile discount code doesn’t exist – you don’t really need it. LegalZoom, for instance, has a basic package that will incorporate a business for $149, which is $100 more than IncFile and doesn’t include the 1st full year of Registered Agent Service that IncFile provides with every package.`,
    text4: `That’s more than $250 you’ll be saving with Incfile that can be put right back to work in your new business. Not to mention, you get Registered Agent service free of charge for a year to keep your business in compliance.`,
    text5: `Even if you go to other incorporation services, you’ll still be paying more even if you have a coupon.`,
    header2: `Here’s What You Get With IncFile for $49`,
    text6: `With IncFile, you can incorporate your business at just $49, plus the state fees which vary depending on your state. Plus, for this price, you can get a lot of services to kickstart your business that you would normally have to pay extra for with other companies.`,
    text7: `Here are the top six reasons why you’ll still be better off without an IncFile coupon code.`,
    list: [
        `Each of the three IncFile packages include Registered Agent service FREE for the first full year.`,
        `IncFile gives you unlimited access to email and phone support to assist with any questions and concerns.`,
        `A FREE 30-minute Business Tax Consultation is provided with every package.`,
        `IncFile has an order tracking tool that will allow you to monitor the status of your order in real time. You can use it anytime of the day!`,
        `Each order includes Next Day Processing. IncFile will conduct a name search, draft your articles and forward to the state for processing in just one business day. Even though the filing times vary per state – IncFile gets them over to the state in one business day, then mails your company formation documents upon the state’s completion.`
    ],
    header3: `Wrapping Up and Incorporating with IncFile`,
    text8: `Unlike many other incorporation service providers, IncFile handles every step of the incorporation process within the company – rather than outsourcing it. As a result, they are able to completely control the incorporation process and make sure it’s done right.`,
    text9: `Like I said before, even though an IncFile coupon doesn’t technically exist, the savings have already been factored in to save you time and money.`,
