    text: `Yes, with some exceptions. When you’re forming a corporation or an LLC in a state, the name must be unique to your business within that state. Others can form LLCs and businesses in other states that have the same name as yours. If you want to protect your business name across all states, you will need to trademark it.`,

    text3: `LLCs and corporations are formed on a “by state” basis. The business formation bodies in these states (typically the Secretary of State or Corporation Division) insist that
        <a href="/" target="_blank">every business has a unique name.</a>
        If your business doesn’t have a unique name, your formation documents will be rejected.`,

    text4: `Having an identical name to another business isn’t the only way to get rejected. If it’s similar to another name and might cause confusion between an existing business and your new business, you won’t be able to use the name.`,
    text5: `For example, you want to create an LLC in New Jersey called “Marvelous Machine” but find out there’s already a business called “Marvelous Machines.” It’s likely that the Secretary of State may reject your name due to it being too close to the original name.`,

    header5: `Just Small Changes to a Business Name May Make It Unique`,
    text7: `It’s common for business formation bodies to accept a name as unique if it differs only slightly from an existing name. This could be as small as adding another word or changing a word slightly. We’ve got some helpful hints on

You can search for names across states with our tool. If you find that someone else is using the name, check whether they have trademarked it. If not, you can form a business with that unique name in your state.`,
