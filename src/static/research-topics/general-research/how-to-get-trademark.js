There’s just one problem: right now, anyone else can use that name too, and you don’t want your inspiration and effort to go to waste. You need to protect your name and brand, and that means getting and filing a registered trademark.`,
    text2: `We’ll walk you through everything you need to do to gather the right information, fill in the correct forms, file your trademark and have it granted. Trademarks are only applicable in the countries where you register them. The information here is based on filing a trademark in the U.S. with the

        (USPTO).`,

    text3: `The term “trademark” is often used as a catch-all phrase for the various ways of protecting your business’s intellectual property. In reality, trademarks are very specific in what they do and do not allow. Before deciding if you need to file a trademark application, it’s worth understanding the type of protection you need.`,

          `Copyright — Protects an artistic or literary piece of work. For example, the photographs of the original blue widget that you use on your website.`,
          `Business name registration — Protects the name of your business in the state you form the business, assuming you’re creating an LLC or corporation. For example, you set up an LLC called “Blue Widget Manufacturing LLC” in Delaware.`,

    header3: `Understand What a Trademark Protects`,
    text5: `Getting a registered trademark means you have the exclusive right to use specific words, phrases and logos to identify your business, products and services. If another business or individual copies something you have trademarked, you can take legal action against them to prevent their usage.`,
    text6: `Trademarks only apply to text or logos that are used for commercial purposes. For example, you can trademark the name of a product or business, but not something that doesn’t generate commercial value or income.`,
    header4: `Realize the Importance of a Distinctive Trademark`,
    text7: `You can’t trademark common, generic or descriptive names. For example, it’s very unlikely you would get a trademark for “Sweeping Broom” as that’s simply descriptive. Instead, a trademark needs to be distinctive and unique.`,
    text8: `If your trademark isn’t unique, it’s likely to be rejected, as there may be confusion with the trademark you want to register and an existing trademark. This confusion can happen if another trademark already exists that is similar to yours and they are used for similar goods and services.`,
    text9: `When you file for a trademark, you will need to specify the types of products or services you will use the trademark on, and the USPTO will decide if the trademark is both distinctive and non-confusable.`,

          `The goods and services that will use the trademark, as this can affect whether you will be granted the mark.`,
          `Your “filing basis” — whether you are already using the trademark for commercial purposes, whether you intend to use the trademark, whether you are already using the trademark elsewhere in the world and whether you have priority due to a foreign application.`,

    header6: `Search the Trademark Database to See If the Mark You Want Is Already in Use`,
