    text: `Understanding why the LLC needs to have an operating agreement in place starts with having a grasp on how corporations are governed. For the most part the affairs of a corporation are largely governed according to the state statutes. The contrary is true for LLC’s. The state statutes for the LLC provide default provisions that will be exercised in the absence of a corresponding provision in the LLC’s operating agreement which means that they only come into play if the terms are not outlined in the operating agreement. While the LLC is registered at the state level the internal affairs of the company are governed by the operating agreement. This is why most state require an LLC to adopt an operating agreement.`,
