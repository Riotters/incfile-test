    text2: `Corporation that want to be taxed a small business corporation file a form with the IRS called Form 2553 and will file their taxes using 1120s tax return. Corporations that do not file this form are taxed as traditional corporations and file the 1120 tax return.`,
    text3: `A C-corporation file a corporate tax return and will pay taxes on the profits. The post tax income may then be distributed to the corporation shareholders in the the form of dividends. The shareholders are then taxed on dividends, which effectively forces the ownership of a corporation to pay taxes on the same earnings twice- once at the corporate level, and then as individual level. This is what is known as “double taxation.”`,

A single member LLC is taxed as sole proprietorship while a LLC with more than one member is taxed a partnership. A very unique advantage of the LLC is that it can elect to be taxed as S-Corporations or even a C – Corporation if it chooses.`,
