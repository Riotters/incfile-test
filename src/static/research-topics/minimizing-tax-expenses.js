You can use an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to defer up to $5,500 in income, although you will pay tax when you withdraw money from the account on retirement. Note that if you also have a separate 401(k) provided by your business, you can only earn up to a certain amount before you lose this deduction. Additionally, you can’t deduct contributions made to a Roth plan, either as an individual or as part of a 401(k).`,
    text9: `If you do have a 401(k) provided by your business, such as a SEP or SIMPLE plan, you can deduct contributions made to the IRA portion of the plan. These plans also have higher contribution and deductible limits than Individual Retirement Accounts.`,
