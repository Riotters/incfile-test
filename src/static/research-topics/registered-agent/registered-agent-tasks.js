  text: `Almost every state requires a corporation or an LLC to have an Registered Agent (sometimes called a resident agent, statutory agent, or agent for service of process). The Registered Agent address is the address that will be used by the state for any official legal and tax correspondence. The Registered Agent address must be a physical, in-state street address; P.O. Boxes are not acceptable.`,
  text2: `The main function of the Registered Agent is to be available during normal business hours so that official legal correspondence may be delivered and signed for if needed. All of our incorporation packages include 1 free year of Registered Agent service.`,
