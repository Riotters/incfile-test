        answer: `A corporate seal is a customized embossing stamp that contains the name, date and state of formation of your company. It is used to create a raised emblem on paper documents.

        question: `Is a corporate seal a requirement?`,

It is, however, a valuable item to have in one's hands when the legitimacy and formality of your company needs to be expressed. In some jurisdictions a corporate Seal can be required to open a company bank account. Check with your particular secretary of state for any possibility that a corporate seal will be required in your locale.`,
