        question: "LLC Tax Filing",
        answer: `<a href="limited-liability-company/">A limited liability company (LLC)</a> is treated as a “pass-through” or “disregarded” entity for tax purposes. This means
                your LLC does not pay taxes itself, instead all of the LLC’s profits or losses are “passed through” directly to the personal tax returns of the owners of the LLC and taxed there.
                <br />
                Even though your LLC is a pass-through entity, it will still need to file some tax forms.`,
        list: [
          "If you run an LLC yourself, you will need to file a 1040 with the appropriate business and self-employment schedules.",
          "If you run an LLC with others, you will need to file a 1065 partnership return, together with a 1040 with the appropriate schedules.",
          "If you have opted to be taxed as an S Corporation, you will need to file an 1120-S S Corporation tax return, together with a 1040 with the appropriate schedules.",
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "S Corporation Tax Filing",
        answer: `If you set up your company to be an S Corporation, or elect to have your LLC file taxes as an S Corporation, this may provide you with some tax advantages to reduce your self-employment tax liability.
        <br />
        S Corporations, like LLCs, do not have to pay corporate income tax. Instead, the company’s income gets passed through to the owners and is reported on the company owners’ personal income tax returns.
        <br />
        The tax treatment of S Corporations is different from LLCs, in that the company owners can choose to pay the members a salary (subject to payroll taxes) and also assign additional income to be treated as a distribution, which is not subject to payroll or self-employment taxes. This gives the owners some flexibility in how they pay themselves from the company’s profits, as well as reducing payroll taxes.`,
        list: [
          `Filing as an S Corporation requires you to <a href="/research-topics/c-corporation-info/form-2553/">file Form 2553: Entity Classification Election.</a>`,
          `You will also need to file an 1120-S: U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation or an 1120-A, the short version of this form.`,
          `Review how the S Corporation can considerably reduce your self-employment tax obligations with our <a href="/s-corporation-tax-calculator/">S Corporation
          Tax Calculator.</a>`,
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "C Corporation Tax Filing",
        answer:
          "A C Corporation is required to pay corporate income tax. Unlike an LLC or S Corporation, this type of business structure is not a pass-through entity. This means your C Corporation will have to pay taxes on the business’s income, and then the business owners will also have to pay personal income tax upon the taxable dividends paid to the owners by the business. This is known as “double taxation” because your company has to pay corporate income tax first, and then you as the business owner have to pay personal income tax.",
        list: [
          "C Corporations are required to file Form 1120: Corporation Income Tax Return.",
          "The owners must report their income from the C Corporation (salary and any dividends) on their personal tax returns.",
          "As the owner of a C Corporation, if you pay yourself a salary, you will also have to pay personal income taxes and other withholdings like payroll tax, based on your salary.",
