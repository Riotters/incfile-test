          question: `STEP 1: Gather Information for Your Members`,
          answer: `First, you need to gather basic information about your LLC, including the names and addresses of the managers or members. The LLC members are typically the people who own and run the business. They are also the ones who can take profits out of the business to pay themselves.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 2: Search for and Choose a Unique Business Name for Your Wyoming LLC`,
          answer: `<p>You will need a distinctive and original name for your Wyoming LLC that’s not used by any other business in WY. To find out if another company is using your chosen business name, carry out a Wyoming business entity name search on the WY Secretary of State website.</p></br>
            <p>There are a few rules you’ll need to follow when choosing an LLC name. You can find out more in our guide to searching for and naming your Wyoming LLC.</p></br>

        {
          question: `STEP 3: Provide an Official Address for Your WY LLC`,
          answer: `Every Wyoming LLC must have a designated street address. That could be your home address (if you’re running the company from your residence), your company’s office building or any physical address of your preference. The address can be outside the state of Wyoming and can be a P.O. Box.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 4: Assign a Registered Agent for Your Wyoming LLC`,
          answer: `<p>Every WY LLC must have a “Registered Agent” when it is formed. This is an official position; the Registered Agent is someone who receives official legal and tax correspondence and has responsibility for filing reports with the Wyoming Secretary of State.</p></br> 
            <p>This position can be filled by you, another manager in the business or a dedicated Registered Agent service. Your WY Registered Agent must have a physical street address in Wyoming and must be present to receive important documents for your company during business hours.</p></br>
            <p>At Incfile, all of our packages include a Wyoming Registered Agent service that is free for the first year and just $119 per year afterward. We also have a dashboard where you can log in and easily view any document your Registered Agent has received on your behalf.</p></br>

        {
          question: `STEP 5: Get an Employee Identification Number (EIN) From the Internal Revenue Service`,
          answer: `You will need an EIN to identify your business to the IRS. You use this number when filing and paying taxes or when submitting payroll information and payments for your employees. You can obtain one directly from the IRS, or we can get one for you as part of the Wyoming LLC business formation process.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 6: File Articles of Organization With the Wyoming Secretary of State`,
          answer: `<p>Once you've gathered all the information for your Wyoming LLC, you’ll need to file a formal document with the WY Secretary of State. This document is known as your “Articles of Organization,” and filing the document creates your Wyoming LLC. Here’s what is typically included:</p></br
            <ol>
                <li>Your business name and address</li>
                <li>Details of your Registered Agent</li>
                <li>Name of the incorporator</li>
            </ol></br>
            <p>You can file your Wyoming LLC Articles of Organization online, mail in a form or have Incfile do it on your behalf. There is a fee to file and start an LLC in Wyoming. You only need to file your Articles of Organization once.</p></br>
