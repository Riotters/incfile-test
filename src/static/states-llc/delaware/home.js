          question: `STEP 1: Gather Information for Your Members`,
          answer: `First, you need to gather basic information about your LLC, including the names and addresses of the managers or members. The LLC members are typically the people who own and run the business. They are also the ones who can take profits out of the business to pay themselves.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 2: Search for and Choose a Unique Business Name for Your Delaware LLC`,
          answer: `<p>You will need a distinctive and original name for your Delaware LLC that’s not used by any other business in DE. This means searching the business registry of the Delaware Division of Corporations. Fortunately, we’ve made that easy with our business search tool. Just enter your proposed business name and we’ll look it up on the registry and let you know if it’s already in use by an LLC or corporation.</p></br>
                   <p>Alternatively, you can visit the Delaware Division of Corporations website and carry out a search. There are a few rules you’ll need to follow when choosing an LLC name. You can find out more in our guide to searching for and naming your Delaware LLC.</p></br>

        },
        {
          question: `STEP 3: STEP 3: Provide an Official Address for your DE LLC`,
          answer: `Every Delaware LLC must have a designated street address. That could be your home address (if you’re running the company from your residence), your company’s office building or any physical address of your preference. The address can be outside the state of Delaware and can be a P.O. Box.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 4: Assign a Registered Agent for Your Delaware LLC`,
          answer: `<p>Every DE LLC must have a “Registered Agent” when it is formed. This is an official position; the Registered Agent is someone who receives official legal and tax correspondence and has responsibility for filing reports with the Delaware Division of Corporations.</p></br>

          <p>This position can be filled by you, another manager in the business or a dedicated Registered Agent service. Your DE Registered Agent must have a physical street address in Delaware and must be present to receive important documents for your company during business hours.</p></br>
          
          <p>At Incfile, all of our packages include a Registered Agent service that is free for the first year and just $119 per year afterward. We also have a dashboard where you can log in and easily view any document your Registered Agent has received on your behalf.</p></br>

        },
        {
          question: `STEP 5: Get an Employee Identification Number (EIN) From the Internal Revenue Service`,
          answer: `You will need an EIN to identify your business to the IRS. You use this number when filing and paying taxes or when submitting payroll information and payments for your employees. You can obtain one directly from the IRS, or we can get one for you as part of the Delaware LLC business formation process.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 6: File a Certificate of Formation With the Delaware Division of Corporations`,
          answer: `<p> Once you've gathered all the information together for your Delaware LLC, you’ll need to file a formal document with the DE Division of Corporations. This document is known as your “Certificate of Formation,” and filing the document creates your Delaware LLC. Here’s what is typically included:</p></br>
                   <ul>
                   <li> Your business name and address </li>
                   <li> Details of your Registered Agent </li>
                   <li> Name of the incorporator </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>You can file your Delaware LLC Certificate of Formation online, mail in a form or have Incfile do it on your behalf. There is a fee to file and start an LLC in Delaware. You only need to file your Certificate of Formation once.</p></br>
