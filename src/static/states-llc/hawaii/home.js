          question: `STEP 1: Gather Information for Your Members`,
          answer: `First, you need to gather basic information about your LLC, including the names and addresses of the managers or members. The LLC members are typically the people who own and run the business. They are also the ones who can take profits out of the business to pay themselves.`,

          question: `STEP 2: Search for and Choose a Unique Business Name for Your Hawaii LLC`,
          answer: `<p>You will need a distinctive and original name for your Hawaii LLC that’s not used by any other business in HI. To find out if another company is using your chosen business name, carry out a Hawaii business entity name search on the HI Business Registration Division website.</p></br>
                   <p>There are a few rules you’ll need to follow when choosing an LLC name. You can find out more in our guide to searching for and naming your Hawaii LLC.</p></br>

        {
          question: `STEP 3: Provide an Official Address for Your HI LLC`,
          answer: `Every Hawaii LLC must have a designated street address. That could be your home address (if you’re running the company from your residence), your company’s office building or any physical address of your preference. The address can be outside the state of Hawaii, but it cannot be a P.O. Box.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 4: Assign a Registered Agent for Your Hawaii LLC`,
          answer: `<p>Every HI LLC must have a “Registered Agent.” This is an official position; the Registered Agent is someone who receives official legal and tax correspondence and has responsibility for filing reports with the Hawaii Business Registration Division.</p></br>

          <p>This position can be filled by you, another manager in the business or a dedicated Registered Agent service. Your HI Registered Agent must have a physical street address in Hawaii and must be present to receive important documents for your company during business hours.</p></br>
          
          <p>At Incfile, all of our packages include a Hawaii Registered Agent service that is free for the first year and just $119 per year afterward. We also have a dashboard where you can log in and easily view any document your Registered Agent has received on your behalf.</p></br>

        },
        {
          question: `STEP 5: Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service`,
          answer: `You will need an EIN to identify your business with the IRS. You use this number when filing and paying taxes or when submitting payroll information and payments for your employees. You can obtain one directly from the IRS, or we can get one for you as part of the Hawaii LLC business formation process.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 6: File Certificate of Organization with the Hawaii Secretary of State`,
          answer: `<p> Once you've gathered all the information for your Hawaii LLC, you’ll need to file a formal document with the HI Business Registration Division. This document is known as your “Articles of Organization,” and filing the document creates your Hawaii LLC. Here’s what is typically included:</p></br>
                   <ul>
                   <li> Your business name and address </li>
                   <li> Details of your Registered Agent </li>
                   <li> Duration of the business </li>
                   <li> Name of the incorporator </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>You can file your Hawaii LLC Articles of Organization online, mail in a form or have Incfile do it on your behalf. There is a fee to file and start an LLC in Hawaii. You only need to file your Articles of Organization once.</p></br>
