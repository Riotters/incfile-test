          answer: `First, you need to gather basic information about your LLC, including the names and addresses of the managers or members. The LLC members are typically the people who own and run the business. They are also the ones who can take profits out of the business to pay themselves.`,

The address must be inside the state of Kentucky and can be a P.O. Box.`,
        },
        {
          question: `STEP 4: Assign a Registered Agent for Your Kentucky LLC`,
          answer: `<p>Every KY LLC must have a “Registered Agent.” This is an official position; the Registered Agent is someone who receives official legal and tax correspondence and has responsibility for filing reports with the Kentucky Secretary of State.</p></br>
            <p>This position can be filled by you, another manager in the business or a dedicated Registered Agent service. Your KY Registered Agent must have a physical street address in Kentucky and must be present to receive important documents for your company during business hours.</p></br>

You can obtain one directly from the IRS, or we can get one for you as part of the Kentucky LLC business formation process.`,

          question: `STEP 6: File Articles of Organization with the Kentucky Secretary of State`,
          answer: `<p>Once you've gathered all the information for your Kentucky LLC, you’ll need to file a formal document with the KY Secretary of State. This document is known as your “Articles of Organization,” and filing the document creates your Kentucky LLC. Here’s what is typically included:</p></br>
            <li>Your business name and address</li>
            <li>Details of your Registered Agent</li>
            <li>Various information about your business including its niche and special ownership</li>
