        question:
          "Can I use a NJ virtual address as my Registered Agent address?",
        answer: `No, we do not recommend it. Generally speaking, your New Jersey Registered Agent should have a real NJ street address where they can receive official, legal correspondence. If you need a Registered Agent in New Jersey, Incfile provides a <a href="/manage-your-company/registered-agent/" target="_blank">Registered Agent service</a> that will meet your needs.`,
