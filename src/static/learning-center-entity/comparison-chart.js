Any liability the business has (e.g. monies owed, equipment, depreciation, lawsuits, etc.) are purely the liability of the business, and do not (generally) have any impact on the individual owner’s personal assets.`,
        header4: `LLC Taxes and Tax Returns`,
        text5: `An LLC does not pay federal income tax itself. Instead, any net profit or loss is “passed through” to the personal tax returns of the owners or members. It is then taxed as personal income by the IRS. In this sense, taxation of an LLC is very similar to taxation of a sole-proprietorship or partnership.`,

            `In certain cases, other types of tax or tariffs may need to be paid by an LLC.`,

This means all income, expenses and other financial matters would be reported on an individual’s personal tax return, and they’d pay tax accordingly. It also means there’s no separation for areas like personal liability.`,
