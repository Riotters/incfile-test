        header2: `Limited Liability Company (LLC)`,

          list: [
            `LLCs are fast and easy to setup.`,
            `LLCs have a simple business structure.`,
            `Forming an LLC is generally inexpensive.`,
            `Running an LLC is easier than running a C Corp or S Corp.`,
            `There are fewer rules, regulations and legal compliance issues for LLCs.`,

        header3: `LLC Limited Liability Protection`,
        text4: `Like C Corps and S Corps, LLCs provide their owners with limited liability protection. This means the business assets are owned separately by the LLC, not by the owners. Any liability the business has (e.g. monies owed, equipment, depreciation, lawsuits, etc.) are purely the liability of the business, and do not (generally) have any impact on the individual owner’s personal assets.`,
        header4: `LLC Taxes and Tax Returns`,
        text5: `An LLC does not pay federal income tax itself. Instead, any net profit or loss is “passed through” to the personal tax returns of the owners or members. It is then taxed as personal income by the IRS. In this sense, taxation of an LLC is very similar to taxation of a sole-proprietorship or partnership.`,
        header5: `Types of Tax an LLC is Liable For`,

            `Payroll tax on salaries paid to employees (but not to members or owners — they will pay self-employment tax on their personal tax returns).`,
            `Sales tax on goods purchased by and for the business.`,
            `Property taxes on owned business property.`,
            `In certain cases, other types of tax or tariffs may need to be paid by an LLC.`,
            `Generally, these taxes can be subtracted as business expenses and do not flow through to individual owner’s tax returns.`,

            `There are some more legalities, rules, and compliance for an S Corp than an LLC.`,
            `An S Corp has a slightly more complex corporate structure.`,

        text3: `Unlike traditional C Corporations, the S Corporation does not need to pay corporate income tax. The S Corporation is a separate tax designation recognized by the IRS. Similar to the LLC, the net profit or loss generated by an S Corporation will flow through to the personal income tax returns of the shareholders and owners, and be subject to tax there.`,
