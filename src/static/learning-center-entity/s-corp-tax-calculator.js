  text3: `There are several areas you will need to pay attention to:`,
  header3: `Reasonable Salary and Compensation`,
  text4: `You must pay a reasonable salary as a salary (not a distribution.) The IRS does not have a clear definition of what a “reasonable salary” is, other than proper compensation for the services provided to the corporation. A good rule of thumb is to look at the “average” salary for the position and pay that as salary, with any excess being paid as a distribution. Failure to do this could result in an audit from the IRS.`,
  header4: `Declaring an LLC Should be Taxed as an S Corp`,
  text5: `Incfile can prepare your paperwork for you to be treated as an S Corp when you setup your LLC and send it to you. You will then need to add your signature and fax or mail into the IRS within 75 days of the date of incorporation to receive the tax election status for the initial year of the business. You can also choose to do this yourself at a later date, by filling in form 2553. However, remember that the IRS still must receive this form within 75 days of the formation of your LLC — whether Incfile prepares your paperwork or you do it yourself — or you will need to wait to the following tax year to make the change.`,
