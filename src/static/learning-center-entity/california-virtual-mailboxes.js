          "Can I use a CA virtual address as my Registered Agent address?",
        answer: `No, we do not recommend it. Generally speaking, your California Registered Agent should have a real CA street address where they can receive official, legal correspondence. If you need a Registered Agent in California, Incfile provides a <a href="/manage-your-company/registered-agent/" target="_blank">Registered Agent service</a> that will meet your needs.`,

        question: "In what states do you provide a Virtual Mailbox service?",
