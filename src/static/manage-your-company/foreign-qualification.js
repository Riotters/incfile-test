        question: `What Is a ”Foreign Qualification”?`,
        answer: `A Foreign Qualification refers to the process by which you register your company to do business in another state. An LLC or corporation is considered "domestic" in the state in which is was formed, and “foreign” in any other state in which it wants to do business. 
                    When you file a Foreign Qualification, you get a Certificate of Authority, which gives you legitimate rights to do business in the state.
                    A Foreign Qualification must be completed in each state in which a corporation or LLC intends to conduct business.`,

        question: `How Businesses Are Classified as Foreign?`,
        answer: `What does it mean to “do business” in a state? Let’s discuss the activities that determine you are conducting business in another state.
                    Essentially, if your actions go beyond minor transactions in a state, such as making management decisions, you will likely be seen as a “foreign” entity that needs to register. 
                    However, there are some simple rules that help weed out the minor from the major “doing business” stature.`,
        list: [
          `First, the company would have a physical presence in the state. This refers to the existence of an office, store or warehouse that services or solicits residents of that state in any form. 
                    It could also refer to having employees or even bank accounts in a state.`,
          `Second, if your company has to pay state taxes in a particular locale, they are going to be tagged as “doing business” in a state. 
                    Taxes are assessed when a company sells directly from a state or upholds a significant number of contracts in a state.`,

                            If a company neglects to file a Foreign Qualification and receive a Certificate of Authority, then it does not have legal standing or authority to transact business within that state.`,

        question: `What Do I Need To Provide in Order To File?`,

      {
        question: `How Much Does It Cost To File a Foreign Qualification?`,
