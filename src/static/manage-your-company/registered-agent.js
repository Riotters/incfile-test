  text3: `Yes. Every LLC or corporation is required to have an official Registered Agent (sometimes called a statutory agent, resident agent or agent for service of process) in each state where it does business. 
      A Registered Agent serves as a permanent physical presence in the state, and the Registered Agent address is where the state government can contact you with legal and tax correspondence, including franchise tax forms, 
      notices of litigation and required annual report forms.`,
  header2: `Why Use a Registered Agent Service?`,
  text4: `Registered Agent services like the one offered by Incfile help you avoid the hassles and inconvenience of managing all of your own documentation from the state. 
      They also help preserve your privacy by setting up a public-facing address for your business that is separate from your home. When you use a Registered Agent service, any official legal or tax correspondence will be forwarded to your personal, 
      private contact address. Incfile’s Registered Agent service also helps you stay on top of deadlines (such as required annual reports) to keep your business in good standing.`,
