    This means that if you were to file your LLC on March 22nd, then you must pay the $800 fee no later than June 15th (in this example, March is Month 1, April is Month 2, May is Month 3, and June is Month 4). Then, every year after your first payment $800 LLC Franchise Tax will be due April 15th. You pay the $800 LLC Franchise Tax using Form 3522 called the LLC Tax Voucher.`,
