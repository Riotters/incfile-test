This means that the company assets are typically owned by the LLC and are separate from the personal assets from that of the LLC owner(s). Should there be a lawsuit aimed at the company, whether with or without merit, the LLC is the legal entity that would be sued. The assets of the LLC could be attacked, however, that would be separate from the personal assets of the LLC owner(s), which would be protected.</p><p>The potential liability of an LLC owner is limited only to whatever that owner has invested in the LLC, such as an initial, investment or any retained earnings. This is very much the same as if you had purchased shares of stock in a corporation. In most cases, the most you can lose is what you paid for the stock, but you typically will not lose more than that, no matter how much the company might potentially lose or for however much the company might be sued.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is an LLC member?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>If you are the owner of an LLC, you are referred to as a member, and LLCs can have a single member or multiple members â€” it's up to you.</p>"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I file an amendment for an LLC?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p>If you need to make a change to your LLC, you need to <a href="/manage-your-company/amendment/" >file an amendment</a> with your secretary of state.
