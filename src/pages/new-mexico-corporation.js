								Choosing a Corporation Name
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Choosing a name for your startup New Mexico corporation is one
								of the first official steps toward actually conducting business
								in the Land of Enchantment. The business name you choose must be
								able to be readily distinguished from the names of all other
								business entities, government organizations, and political
								parties registered of reserved on the New Mexico state rolls.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Your new business’ name must include one of the following words
								or an abbreviation thereof: “Incorporated,” “Corporation,”
								“Company,” or “Limited.” The name also must not state or imply
								that the corporation is organized for some purpose other than
								the one specified in its articles of incorporation or one
								permitted by state law.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								Available corporate names may be reserved for up to 120 days for

								Articles of Incorporation
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Before they can start operations, New Mexico corporations must
								file articles of incorporation with the Corporations Bureau of
								the state Public Regulation Commission. The articles must be
								delivered by at least one incorporator, accompanied by the
								filing fee. The filing fee, based on the number of shares
								authorized in the articles, is $1 for each 1,000 shares
								authorized, with a minimum amount of $100.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The following information must be included in the articles of
								incorporation:

								New Mexico law also allows (but does not require) optional items
								to be included in the articles of incorporation for those
								corporations who wish to formally specify additional
								information, such as:

							<Paragraph big>
								New Mexico does not require a new corporation to state a par
								value for shares. Most incorporators authorize one class of
								common shares with equal voting, dividend, and liquidation
								rights and no special restrictions. Most incorporators simply
								authorize 100,000 shares, which is the most you can authorize
								for the minimum filing fee of $100.

								is the same as the registered office, or a corporation with a
								business office identical to the registered office.

A popular option is a “corporation“—but what does this mean for business owners?   A corporation is its own legal entity separate from the owners. It has nearly all the legal rights of an individual: It can hire employees, own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, loan and borrow money, and pay taxes. But since the corporation exists as a separate entity, it limits the liability of its owners. That means shareholders have the right to participate in profits, but they’re not held personally liable for the company’s debts. And since a corporation isn’t linked to a single person, it doesn’t dissolve when its owners or shareholders change or die, so liability protection is passed on to the next in line.
