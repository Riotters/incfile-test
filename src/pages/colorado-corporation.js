								Choosing a Corporation Name
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Your new corporation’s name must be distinguishable from the
								name of any other registered or reserved Colorado business
								entity. It must also contain the words “incorporated,”
								“corporation,” “limited,” or “company,” or an abbreviation of
								these same terms. It may also not contain language stating or
								implying that it is organized for a purpose other than one
								permitted by state law or stated in its articles of
								incorporation.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								If your corporate name is not considered to be distinguishable
								from one already on file with the state or in use, it’s not
								enough to merely change some punctuation, a definite or
								indefinite article (such as “a,” “an,” or “the”), or the status
								designator (“corporation,” “company,” “incorporated,” “limited,”
								etc.).
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								Corporate names can be reserved with the state for up to 120
								days at a time for $10.

							<Paragraph big>
								A corporation must maintain its bylaws at its main executive
								office, but is not required to file them with the state. The

								corporation’s bylaws at its initial meeting-insuring that they
								do not conflict with the articles of incorporation-and keep them
								updated as time goes on.

							<Paragraph big>
								The board of directors is responsible for making major decisions
								for the corporation. Officers of the company must be listed in
								the bylaws or elected by the board. At least one officer must
								authenticate records for the corporation, as well as prepare
								minutes of directors’ and shareholders meetings. Any officer may
								hold more than one office in the corporation unless otherwise
								prohibited by law.

								A Colorado corporation must file an annual report with the
								Colorado Secretary of State each year that includes the
								corporation’s name, principal office, names and addresses of

								strongly encourages electronic filing of annual reports.

								Taxes
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Colorado has both a corporate income tax and a sales tax for
								businesses; actual rates depend on the type and amount of
								business activity.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								A “subchapter S” corporation or “S-Corporation” is one that
								chooses to be treated as a pass-through entity (the same way as
								a sole proprietorship or partnership) for tax purposes, meaning
								that the tax-related information for the “S-Corp” is filed as
								part of the owner’s individual income tax. Since Colorado has a
								state income tax, a subchapter-S choice when forming a
								corporation affects state and federal taxes for Centennial State
								corporations.

A popular option is a “corporation“—but what does this mean for business owners?   A corporation is its own legal entity separate from the owners. It has nearly all the legal rights of an individual: It can hire employees, own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, loan and borrow money, and pay taxes. But since the corporation exists as a separate entity, it limits the liability of its owners. That means shareholders have the right to participate in profits, but they’re not held personally liable for the company’s debts. And since a corporation isn’t linked to a single person, it doesn’t dissolve when its owners or shareholders change or die, so liability protection is passed on to the next in line.
