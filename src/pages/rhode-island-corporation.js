								Choosing a Corporation Name
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Choosing a name for your new Rhode Island corporation is one of
								the first official steps toward actually conducting business in
								the state. The corporate name you choose must be distinguishable
								from all other registered and reserved business entities on the
								Rhode Island state rolls.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Your new business’ name must include one of the following words,
								an abbreviation thereof: “Incorporated,” “Corporation,”
								“Company,” or “Limited.” However, the name must not state or
								imply that the corporation is organized for some purpose other
								than the one specified in its articles of incorporation or one
								permitted by state law.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								An available corporate name may be reserved for 120 days for a
								$50 fee.

								Articles of Incorporation
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Before it can legally operate in the state, a new Rhode Island
								corporation must file articles of incorporation with the
								Corporations Division of the state Secretary of State’s office.
								In order to perfect the corporation’s organization,
								incorporators have all the powers of shareholders or directors
								until stock is issued or directors are elected.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The minimum filing fee is $230, which includes a minimum $160
								license fee plus a $70 filing fee. You may authorize up to (but
								not including) 75,000,000 shares in your articles for the
								minimum $160 license fee. However, if you authorize 75,000,00 or
								more shares, the fee jumps to an amount calculated at the rate
								of one-fifth cent ($.002) per share for each authorized share.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The following information must be included in the articles of
								incorporation:

								Registered Agent and Office
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Every Rhode Island corporation must have a registered agent in
								the state-the person or office designated to receive official
								state correspondence, both administrative and legal. The
								registered agent is required to acknowledge acceptance of the
								appointment as such in writing.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The registered agent must be either a Rhode Island resident
								whose business office is the same as the registered office, or a
								corporation authorized to conduct business in the state that has
								a business office identical to the registered office.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								When a corporation’s registered agent is an attorney, the
								business address of the agent does not have to be identical to
								the registered office, but may be the usual business address of
								the attorney.

								Bylaws
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Bylaws lay out the corporation’s basic managerial and legal
								operating principles that manage their internal affairs. Rhode
								Island corporations must keep a copy of their bylaws at their
								principal executive office, but are not required to file them
								with the state. At its initial meeting, the incorporators or the
								board of directors should adopt corporate bylaws, and then keep
								them updated as time goes on.

								Taxes

							<Paragraph big>
								Rhode Island corporations are subject to a corporate income tax
								of nine percent on all corporate income. The minimum annual
								payment is $250. Among states levying corporate income taxes,
								Rhode Island’s rate ranks 7th highest nationally.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								“S corporation” status is recognized by the Rhode Island
								Secretary of State. A “subchapter S” corporation (frequently
								referred to as an “S corp”) is treated as a pass-through entity
								for tax purposes in the same way as a sole proprietorship or
								partnership. The S corp does not file a tax return on its own
								behalf; instead, all tax-related data for the S corp is filed as
								part of the owner’s individual income tax.

A popular option is a “corporation“—but what does this mean for business owners?   A corporation is its own legal entity separate from the owners. It has nearly all the legal rights of an individual: It can hire employees, own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, loan and borrow money, and pay taxes. But since the corporation exists as a separate entity, it limits the liability of its owners. That means shareholders have the right to participate in profits, but they’re not held personally liable for the company’s debts. And since a corporation isn’t linked to a single person, it doesn’t dissolve when its owners or shareholders change or die, so liability protection is passed on to the next in line.
