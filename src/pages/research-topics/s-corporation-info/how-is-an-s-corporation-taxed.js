                        Corporation. Typically, the S Corporation files its annual return using the Form 1120S, as
                        opposed to the 1120 for a C Corporation. The 1120S is an informational return; it simply informs
                        the federal tax authorities the amount of net profit/loss made by the S Corporation, the
                        shareholders amongst which the profit/loss will be distributed, and the proportion in which the
                        profit/loss is distributed to the shareholders. There is no tax payment/refund associated with the
                        1120S tax return, as the S Corporation does not have the independent tax status that a C
                        Corporation has. Instead, the profits/losses of the S Corporation are considered distributed to
                        the shareholders in proportion to the ownership interest of the shareholder."
