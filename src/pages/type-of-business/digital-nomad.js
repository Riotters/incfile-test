                            So, what is a digital nomad business? There are lots of definitions, but we think a digital
                            nomad business is one where you can run the business from anywhere in the world with an
                            internet connection, sometimes even when you're on the road.

                            In fact, the only requirement to being a digital nomad is the ability to work remotely from
                            anywhere. That means developers, creatives, sellers, marketers, freelance writers, gig
                            providers and more can all be digital nomads. The idea of the "gig economy" and the digital
                            nomad go hand-in-hand.

                            Being a digital nomad has big risks and big rewards. On the risk side you have to deal with
                            a large amount of uncertainty in terms of cash flow, projects, clients and more. On the
                            reward side, you get to work from anywhere, succeed entirely on your own merits and have the
                            satisfaction of creating a business that helps others be successful.
