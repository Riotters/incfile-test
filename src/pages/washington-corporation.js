								Choosing a Corporation Name
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								The name you decide on for your new corporation cannot be the
								same as or deceptively similar to the name of any other
								Washington business entity registered or reserved with the
								state. The name may not include language that states or implies
								that the corporation is organized for some purpose other than
								one permitted by state law or than stated in its articles of
								incorporation. The name must also include the words
								“incorporated,” “corporation,” “limited,” or “company,” or an
								abbreviation of one of those terms.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								If your corporate name is not considered sufficiently
								distinguishable from one already on file with the state, it’s
								not enough to just change some punctuation, a definite or
								indefinite article (such as “a,” “an,” or “the”), or the status
								designator (“corporation,” “company,” “incorporated,” “limited,”
								etc.). You have to make a significant change.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								Corporate names can be reserved with the state for a $30 fee for
								up to 180 days at a time.

								Bylaws

							<Paragraph big>
								A corporation is required to keep its bylaws available at its

								adopt the corporation’s bylaws at their first meeting, insuring
								that there is no conflict with the corporation’s articles of
								incorporation. They should also keep them updated as time goes
								on.

								The board of directors has the responsibility of making the

								either listed in the bylaws or elected by the board. At least
								one officer must authenticate the corporation’s records, as well

								Taxes

								Washington State does not have an income tax for individuals or

								subject to Business and Occupation (B&O) tax that depends on the
								gross revenue received from business activities in Washington.
								The actual tax rates depend on the type of business activity and
								its levels.

A popular option is a “corporation“—but what does this mean for business owners?   A corporation is its own legal entity separate from the owners. It has nearly all the legal rights of an individual: It can hire employees, own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, loan and borrow money, and pay taxes. But since the corporation exists as a separate entity, it limits the liability of its owners. That means shareholders have the right to participate in profits, but they’re not held personally liable for the company’s debts. And since a corporation isn’t linked to a single person, it doesn’t dissolve when its owners or shareholders change or die, so liability protection is passed on to the next in line.
