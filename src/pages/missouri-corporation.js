								Choosing a Corporation Name
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								The name of your new Missouri corporation is very important-it’s
								one of the first official acts of your business organization,
								and it’s how people first meet your company.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Your company’s name must be able to be told apart from any other
								registered Missouri business entity (as well as any reserved
								names on file). It must be in English or at least written with
								English letters. It must also contain one or more of the
								following words (or an abbreviation thereof): “Incorporated,”
								“Corporation,” “Company” (but this must not follow the word
								“and” or a symb ol for “and”), or “Limited.”
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Your corporation’s name also is not allowed to include language
								that states or gives the impression that the corporation is a
								governmental agency, or that it is organized for any purpose
								other than one permitted by state law and its articles of
								incorporation.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								You can reserve a corporate name that’s not already taken for up
								to 60 days for a $25 fee.

								Articles of Incorporation
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								After choosing a name, the next step for your new Missouri
								corporation is filing articles of incorporation. The articles
								must specify the corporation’s purpose-Missouri allows a
								corporation to be formed for any lawful business activity. The
								articles must include whether the corporation is to be perpetual
								or of limited duration and the name and address of the
								corporation’s initial Registered Agent. The articles should also
								define any limits to (or specify the elimination of) directors’
								liability to the corporation or the shareholders for monetary
								damages.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The articles must be delivered to the state secretary of state’s
								office by at least one of the incorporators. There must be at
								least one incorporator; all of them must be a natural person
								(not just a legal entity) of at least 18 years age. Their duties
								are to sign, verify, and deliver in duplicate those articles of
								incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles must
								include the name(s) and address(es) of the incorporators.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The filing fee is $3, plus a minimum authorized stock fee of at
								least $55, which makes the minimum incorporation fee $58. The
								stock portion of the fee is based on the authorized amount of
								capital for the new corporation, which must be specified in the
								articles. The new corporation can authorize up to $30,000 of
								capital for the minimum $55 stock fee; for each additional
								$10,000 of authorized capital, the stock portion of the fee will
								increase by $5.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Missouri also also allows optional provisions to be included in
								the articles of incorporation. These can be items such as the
								number of members of the board of directors, provisions that
								limit or define the liability of directors, or whether
								shareholders may preemptively acquire additional shares.

								Registered Agent and Office
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Missouri corporations must each have a registered, in-state
								agent. The Registered Agent is the person or business entity
								designated to receive official state correspondence, including
								notice if the corporation is “served” with a lawsuit.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Likewise, the state requires that all corporations maintain a
								registered, in-state office that may be its primary place of
								business. The Registered Agent must maintain a business office
								identical to the registered office, and must be either an
								individual person living in Missouri or a corporation authorized
								to conduct business in the “Show Me” State.

								Bylaws
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Bylaws lay out a corporation’s basic managerial and legal
								operating principles; the corporation must keep a copy at its
								main office, but is not required to file them with the state.
								Nonetheless, they are a critically important document for the
								corporation.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								At its initial meeting, the board of directors should adopt
								corporate bylaws, and then keep them updated as time goes on.
								The corporation’s board of directors can make, alter, amend, or
								repeal those bylaws, unless the articles of incorporation
								reserve this right to the shareholders.

								Directors

							<Paragraph big>
								Officers may be listed in the bylaws or elected by the board in
								compliance with the bylaws. A corporation must have at least a
								president and a secretary, chosen by the directors. An officer
								may hold more than one office in the corporation unless the
								articles of incorporation or bylaws say otherwise.

							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "48px" }}>
								An annual report must be filed with the Missouri Secretary of
								State in the month that the company was originally incorporated
								(except for the first calendar year of incorporation). This
								report must include the corporation’s name, the names and

								Taxes
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								The state of Missouri does impose a corporate income tax
								calculated based on the corporation’s net income. Determining
								that taxable income starts with deducting operating expenses and
								proceeds to reach the net taxable income reported for federal
								tax purposes. The corporation may also deduct half of federal
								income tax payments before calculating next taxable income for
								state purposes. The Missouri state corporate income tax rate is
								6.25%.

A popular option is a “corporation“—but what does this mean for business owners?   A corporation is its own legal entity separate from the owners. It has nearly all the legal rights of an individual: It can hire employees, own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, loan and borrow money, and pay taxes. But since the corporation exists as a separate entity, it limits the liability of its owners. That means shareholders have the right to participate in profits, but they’re not held personally liable for the company’s debts. And since a corporation isn’t linked to a single person, it doesn’t dissolve when its owners or shareholders change or die, so liability protection is passed on to the next in line.
