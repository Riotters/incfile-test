								Choosing a Corporation Name
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Choosing a name for your new Vermont corporation is one of the
								first official steps toward actually conducting business in the
								state. The corporate name you choose must be readily
								distinguishable from all other registered and reserved business
								entities and it may not state or imply that the corporation is
								organized for some purpose other than specified in its articles
								of incorporation or permitted by state law.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Your new business’ name must include one of the following words,
								an abbreviation thereof, or words of similar meaning in another
								language: “Incorporated,” “Corporation,” “Limited,” or
								“Company.”
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								An available corporate name may be reserved for up to four
								months by for a $20 fee.

								Articles of Incorporation
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Before it can legitimately begin operations in the state, a new
								Vermont corporation must file articles of incorporation with the
								Vermont Corporations Division of the Secretary of State’s
								office. The articles must be executed (signed) and delivered by
								at least one incorporator—who must be a natural person (not a
								business entity) of legal age—and accompanied by the $75 filing
								fee. The following information must be included in the articles:

								Vermont also permits optional provisions to be included in the
								articles, such as:

								Registered Agent and Office
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Every Vermont corporation must have a registered agent in the
								state—the person or office designated to receive official state
								administrative and legal correspondence.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The registered agent must be either a Vermont resident whose
								business office is the same as the registered office, or a
								corporation authorized to conduct business in Vermont that has a
								business office identical to the registered office.

								Bylaws
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Bylaws lay out the corporation’s basic managerial and legal
								operating principles that manage their internal affairs. Vermont
								corporations must keep a copy of their bylaws at their principal
								executive office, but are not required to file them with the
								state.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								At its initial meeting, the incorporators or the board of
								directors should adopt corporate bylaws, and then keep them
								updated as time goes on. If no directors have been elected the
								incorporators may adopt initial bylaws for the corporation. If
								neither the incorporators nor the board of directors have
								adopted initial bylaws, the shareholders may do so.

								Taxes

							<Paragraph big>
								Vermont’s corporate tax system has three brackets with an annual
								minimum payment of $250 and a top rate of 8.5 percent on
								corporate income of over $25,000.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The Green Mountain State recognizes “S corporation” status. A
								“subchapter S” corporation (frequently referred to as an “S
								corp”) is treated as a pass-through entity for tax purposes in
								the same way as a sole proprietorship or partnership. The S corp
								does not file a tax return on its own behalf. Instead, all
								tax-related data for the S corp is filed as part of the owner’s
								individual income tax.

A popular option is a “corporation“—but what does this mean for business owners?   A corporation is its own legal entity separate from the owners. It has nearly all the legal rights of an individual: It can hire employees, own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, loan and borrow money, and pay taxes. But since the corporation exists as a separate entity, it limits the liability of its owners. That means shareholders have the right to participate in profits, but they’re not held personally liable for the company’s debts. And since a corporation isn’t linked to a single person, it doesn’t dissolve when its owners or shareholders change or die, so liability protection is passed on to the next in line.
