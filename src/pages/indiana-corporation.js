								Choosing a Corporation Name
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Choosing a name for your new Indiana corporation is one of the
								first official steps toward actually conducting business in the
								Hoosier State. The business name you choose must be able to be
								readily distinguished from all other registered and reserved
								Indiana business entities.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Your new business’ name must end with “Incorporated,”
								“Corporation,” “Company,” or “Limited,” or the abbreviation
								“Corp.,” “Inc.,” “Co.,” or “Ltd.” It may not contain language
								stating or implying that the corporation is organized for a
								purpose other than that permitted by state law and its own
								articles of incorporation.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The name is allowed to include the word “bank” or “banks” for a
								bank holding company, so long as it does not imply that it
								offers the same services as a bank or trust company.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big style={{ marginBottom: "32px" }}>
								Available corporate names may be reserved for up to 120 days for
								$20.

								Articles of Incorporation
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								New Indiana corporations must file articles of incorporation
								with the Indiana Secretary of State’s office before they can
								start conducting business as a corporation. The articles must be
								delivered by at least one of the incorporators, accompanied by
								the filing fee of $90. The incorporator does not have to be a
								director, officer, or shareholder of the corporation.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								The following information must be included in the articles of
								incorporation:
							</Paragraph>

							<Colorbox
								color={color.blue3}
								content={articlesOfIncorporation.box1}
								dotsColor={color.blue1}
								style={{ marginBottom: "65px" }}
							/>

							<Paragraph big>
								Indiana law allows a corporation to be formed for any lawful
								business activity. There is no requirement for a specific
								corporate purpose to be stated in the articles of incorporation.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								Indiana law also allows (but does not require) optional items to
								be included in the articles of incorporation for those
								corporations who wish to formally specify additional
								information, such as:
							</Paragraph>

							<Colorbox
								color={color.orange3}
								content={articlesOfIncorporation.box2}
								dotsColor={color.orange1}
								style={{ marginBottom: "48px" }}
							/>

							<Paragraph big>
								Since Indiana law does not use the concept of par value for
								stocks, you do not need to state a par value for your shares.
								The filing fee is a flat fee, rather than being based on your
								authorized shares, so you can authorize as many as desired.

								Registered Agent and Office
							</Heading>
							<Paragraph big>
								Indiana corporations must have a registered agent in the
								state-someone officially designated to receive state legal and
								administrative correspondence. A corporation’s registered agent
								may be an individual who resides in Indiana, or a business
								entity authorized to conduct business in the state. In either
								circumstance, the registered agent’s business office must be the
								same as the corporation’s registered office.

								Bylaws

							<Paragraph big>
								Bylaws describe the corporation’s basic managerial and legal
								operating principles. An Indiana corporation must keep a copy of
								its bylaws at its main executive office, but is not required to
								file them with the state. At its initial meeting, the board of
								directors should adopt corporate bylaws, and then keep them
								updated as time goes on.

								shareholder meetings, and for authenticating corporate records.
							</Paragraph>
							<Paragraph big>
								It is permissible for an officer to hold more than one office in
								the corporation unless otherwise prohibited by law or by the
								corporation’s bylaws. One person may hold all or any combination
								of offices when all of the issued and outstanding stock of the
								corporation is owned by this same person.

A popular option is a “corporation“—but what does this mean for business owners?   A corporation is its own legal entity separate from the owners. It has nearly all the legal rights of an individual: It can hire employees, own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, loan and borrow money, and pay taxes. But since the corporation exists as a separate entity, it limits the liability of its owners. That means shareholders have the right to participate in profits, but they’re not held personally liable for the company’s debts. And since a corporation isn’t linked to a single person, it doesn’t dissolve when its owners or shareholders change or die, so liability protection is passed on to the next in line.
