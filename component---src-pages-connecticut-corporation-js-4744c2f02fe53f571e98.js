The C Corporation pays federal taxes on the net profits (after all expenses, including salaries and bonuses) of the business by filing the 1120 form with the IRS. The after tax profits can be paid out to the owners (shareholders) in the form of dividends, or retained for reinvestment of the business. The first $50,000 of net income is only federally taxed at 15% rate, and the next $25,000 is taxed at a 25% rate. Different states have different rules on how they tax corporations."},{question:"What is the Management Structure of an Corporation?",answer:"An LLC is typically managed by its members/owners (referred to as member-managed). In that respect an LLC is unlike a corporation, which has a much more rigid and defined management structure, including directors and officers. All owners of the LLC are typically referred to as members, and they can have control and voting interest proportional to their ownership interest, or in proportions different from their ownership interest; however the members agree."},{question:"Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?",answer:"There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC."},{question:"Can I form an Corporation with just one member?",answer:"There was a time when almost every state required the LLC to have two or more members, but that is no longer the case. This important change came in response to revised IRS regulations that clearly permitted single-member LLCs. As a result, in most states, if you plan to be the sole owner of a business and you wish to limit your personal liability, you can choose between forming a corporation or an LLC."},{question:"What is an Operating Agreement?",answer:"The operating agreement is akin to a partnership agreement for a General Partnership or Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). It is an internal contract amongst the members/owners of the LLC, and it lays out such things as ownership interest, member responsibilities, accounting method, adding or removing members, terms for concluding the LLC, etc. It is generally not required by a given state for forming an LLC (with the exception of New York), although it is certainly recommended. When dealing with private companies for financing issues (loans, mortgages, etc.) it may be required by that company. A customizable operating agreement is included with the LLC/Corp Kit."},{question:"Can another business entity be a member of an Corporation?",answer:"In the majority of states, The members of an LLC can be individuals, corporations, or other LLCs. These members of the LLC can be out of state residents or even foreign nationals. Furthermore there is no limit to the amount of members that an LLC can have. The flexibility of an LLC in contrast to an S Corporation is stark considering the S corporations are limited to 75 shareholders who must either be United States citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents."}]},b={header:"Included in all of our packages",items:[{headline:"Verify Company Name Availability",text:"We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you as long \nas needed to find an available company name."},{headline:"Preparation & Filing of Articles",text:"We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the state \nof formation."},{headline:"Next Business Day Processing",text:"We strive to ensure that every order received \nis prepared and forwarded to the state within \n1 business day."},{headline:"Lifetime Customer Support",text:"We are always here to help no matter how long ago you placed your order, whether you have a general question or need a copy of a previously filed document."},{headline:"Lifetime Company Alerts",text:"Never miss an important filing date again.
